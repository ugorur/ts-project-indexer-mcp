## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-31

### üöÄ Major Configuration Improvements

#### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Removed argument-based project path usage from MCP server
- Project paths now must be specified via the `analyze_project` tool's `projectPath` parameter
- All project paths must be absolute paths for better reliability and security
- Improved MCP client integration by removing command-line argument dependencies

#### Updated
- **Documentation**: Updated USAGE.md with new configuration examples
- **Logs**: Converted all Turkish log messages to English for international users
- **Configuration**: Simplified MCP server configuration (no more project path in args)

#### Benefits
- üîí **Better Security**: Absolute path requirements prevent relative path vulnerabilities
- üîß **Cleaner Integration**: MCP clients no longer need to specify project paths in configuration
- üåç **International Support**: All logging now in English
- üìä **Flexible Usage**: Multiple projects can be analyzed in a single session

#### Migration Guide
**Before v1.1.0:**
```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "ts-project-indexer-mcp", "/path/to/project"]
}
```

**After v1.1.0:**
```json
{
  "command": "npx", 
  "args": ["-y", "ts-project-indexer-mcp"]
}
```

Then use the `analyze_project` tool with absolute path:
```javascript
await mcp.callTool('analyze_project', {
  projectPath: '/absolute/path/to/project'
})
```

#### Technical Details
- Removed project path parsing from command line arguments
- Enhanced `analyze_project` tool to enforce absolute path validation
- Improved error messages for better debugging experience
- Streamlined server initialization process
